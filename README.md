<h2> About Daily Scrum </h2>
An old application I've made to learn blazor. Besides blazor it uses asp.net core and postgreSQL database. <br> The app allows user
to create projects, which can be then managed using sprints and issues (like its done in agile methodologies). <br> Each issue can be put on a kanban board according to its current state (todo/in progress/done, etc...).

The application still misses a lot of key features (like users management), which I'm not interested in implementing, since it
was just a learning project for me. There are also some architectural flaws which I'd have done diffrently if I were to remake the app from scratch nowadays (flaws like wrong layers separation/naming and so on).
