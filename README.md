An old application I've made to learn blazor. Besides blazor it uses asp.net core and postgreSQL database. The app allows user
to create projects, which can be then managed using sprints and issues (like its done in agile methodologies). Each issue can be put on a kanban board according to its current state (todo/in progress/done, etc...).

The application still misses a lot of key features (like users management), which I'm not interested in implementing, since it
was just a learning project for me. There are also some architectural flaws which I'd have done diffrently if I were to remake the app from scratch nowadays.
